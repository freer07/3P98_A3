# OpenGL Particle Cannon 
### Real Time Graphics Assignment
This assignment was a demonstation of 3D animation programming using OpenGL.  
We created a particle cannon animation which spawned 3D objects of random sizes and trajectories.   
The objects are annimated in **real time**, including their interactions with the surface that they "bounce" off.

3 = Semi-Auto ('F' to fire)  
S = start/stop random speeds
G = Gouraud shaded
H = (default)Flat shaded
Left mouse = rotate left faster
Right mouse = rotate right faster
